# Getting started
1. Clone the repo. This will get the jupyter notebook along with 'call_recording'
directory that contains wav files that have the recorded instructions.
2. Simply run all the cells of the jupyter notebook downloaded.

## Creating recordings
I just recorded my voice for each exercise instruction using record_voice.ipynb.
The directory in which recordings get stored is 'call_recording', which is set in
this notebook and hard-coded as string in workout notebooks.
